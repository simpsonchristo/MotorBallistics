SRM analysis (ballistic elements, 1D analysis)
Using AJ 60A solid rocket motor (SRM) specific geometry as the test case, we are constructing a ballistic element analysis.
This means a 1D analysis of individual element mass flow, pressure, and speed of the gas produced. We will use all of these
individual elements to produce a chamber pressure and thrust history.
